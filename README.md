This is a Character Case Converter Web App, which basically does that converts upper case letters into lowercase letters. Everytime I get codes from my colleagues and teachers in uppercase letters, and everytime I've to visit case converting websites. Hence I thought why not create my own case converting website instead of visiting other's website and getting that annoying ad popups, Hence, problem solved! and it's fully responsive too!
